MongoDB One-Window Automation Framework

Automation framework using Java, Selenium, Cucumber (BDD) with MongoDB backend for One-Window onboarding workflows.

Overview

This project showcases my expertise in test automation and BDD (Behavior Driven Development).
It provides scalable, maintainable automated tests for One-Window onboarding workflows, designed for readability, reusability, and modularity.

The project demonstrates my automation engineering skills, including:

Selenium WebDriver for UI automation

Cucumber & Gherkin for BDD-style scenarios

Java for development

MongoDB for backend data integration

⚠️ Note: This project demonstrates automation and BDD skills using MongoDB as a data source; it does not require external enterprise systems to run.

Technology Stack

Java – programming language

Selenium WebDriver – automated UI testing

Cucumber & Gherkin – BDD for human-readable test scenarios

MongoDB – backend data integration

Key Achievements

Developed end-to-end automated tests for One-Window onboarding workflows

Integrated MongoDB to dynamically fetch test data

Implemented reusable step definitions for maintainability and scalability

Structured tests for easy extension and modularity

Demonstrated hands-on expertise in enterprise automation and BDD practices

Project Structure & Approach

Step definitions follow modular design principles

MongoDB serves as a dynamic data source instead of static Excel files

Focus is on demonstrating automation methodology and BDD practices
