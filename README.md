# MongoDB One-Window Automation Framework
Automation framework using Java, Selenium, Cucumber (BDD) with MongoDB backend data integration for One-Window onboarding workflows.

---

## Overview
This project showcases my expertise in test automation and BDD (Behavior Driven Development).  
It provides scalable, maintainable automated tests for One-Window onboarding workflows, designed for readability, reusability, and modularity.

The project demonstrates my automation engineering skills, including:

- Selenium WebDriver for UI automation
- Cucumber for BDD-style scenarios
- Java and Maven for development and dependency management
- MongoDB backend integration to fetch test data dynamically

⚠️ **Note:** The code demonstrates my automation and BDD skills; it can be run in a local/test environment with MongoDB backend configuration.

## Technology Stack
- **Java** – programming language  
- **Selenium WebDriver** – automated UI testing  
- **Cucumber** – BDD for human-readable test scenarios  
- **MongoDB** – backend data integration for dynamic test data  
- **Maven** – build and dependency management  

---

## Key Achievements
- Developed end-to-end automated tests for One-Window onboarding workflows  
- Integrated MongoDB backend for dynamic data-driven testing  
- Implemented reusable step definitions and page objects for maintainability  
- Structured tests for easy extension and modularity  
- Demonstrated hands-on expertise in enterprise automation and BDD practices  

---

## Project Structure & Approach
- Test scenarios are written in Cucumber (BDD) style, focusing on clear business workflows  
- Step definitions and page objects follow modular design principles  
- MongoDB backend is used to feed dynamic test data in place of Excel or Gherkin data  
- Focus is on demonstrating automation methodology and data-driven testing
