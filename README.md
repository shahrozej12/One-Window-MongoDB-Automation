# MongoDB One-Window Automation Framework

Automation framework using **Java**, **Selenium**, and **Cucumber (BDD)** with **MongoDB backend data integration** for One-Window onboarding workflows.

---

## Overview

This project showcases my expertise in **test automation and BDD (Behavior Driven Development)**.  
It provides **scalable, maintainable automated tests** for One-Window onboarding workflows, designed for **readability, reusability, and modularity**.

The project demonstrates my **automation engineering skills**, including:

- Selenium WebDriver for UI automation
- Cucumber for BDD-style scenarios
- Java and Maven for development and dependency management
- MongoDB backend integration to fetch dynamic test data

> ⚠️ **Note:** The code demonstrates my automation and BDD skills; it can be run in a local/test environment with MongoDB backend configuration.

## Technology Stack

- **Java** – programming language  
- **Selenium WebDriver** – automated UI testing  
- **Cucumber** – BDD for human-readable test scenarios  
- **MongoDB** – backend data integration for dynamic test data  
- **Maven** – build and dependency management  

---

## Key Achievements

- Developed **end-to-end automated tests** for One-Window onboarding workflows  
- Integrated **MongoDB backend** for dynamic data-driven testing  
- Implemented **reusable step definitions and page objects** for maintainability  
- Structured tests for **easy extension and modularity**  
- Demonstrated hands-on expertise in **enterprise automation and BDD practices**  

---

## Project Structure & Approach

- Test scenarios are written in **Cucumber (BDD)** style, focusing on clear business workflows  
- Step definitions and page objects follow **modular design principles**  
- **MongoDB backend** is used to feed dynamic test data instead of Excel or static files  
- Focus is on demonstrating **automation methodology and dynamic data handling**

## 🎥 Automation Recording

A **screen recording of the automated workflow** is included in the repository.  

It demonstrates:

- Fully automated One-Window onboarding workflows  
- Dynamic test data retrieval from MongoDB  
- Execution of multiple BDD scenarios using Cucumber  
- Pure automation without manual intervention  

**Path in repository:** `/output.avi`  

Recruiters and stakeholders can review this recording to see the framework in action.
